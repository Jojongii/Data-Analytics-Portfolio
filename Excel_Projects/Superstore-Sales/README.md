# 🏪 Superstore Sales Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a **Superstore** dataset to uncover trends and insights. The goal was to explore key performance metrics, identify trends over time, and create an interactive **Excel Dashboard** to present the findings.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)  
- **Time Period:** 2014 - 2017  
- **Attributes:** Order Date, Sales, Profit, Category, Sub-category, Region, etc.

## 🔍 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned and prepped:
1. **Removed duplicates** and checked for missing values.
2. **Standardized column names** for consistency.
3. **Converted date formats** to ensure proper analysis.
4. **Created calculated fields** (e.g., Profit %, Sales per Order).

## 📊 Pivot Table Transformation
After cleaning the dataset, pivot tables were used to extract key insights:
1. Summarized Sales & Profit by Category and Sub-Category
2. Created Yearly and Monthly Sales Trends
3. Filtered by Region & Customer Segment
4. Calculated Key Metrics (Total Sales, Profit %, Units Sold, Average Sale per Order)
