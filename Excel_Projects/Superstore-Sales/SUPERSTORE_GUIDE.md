- **Attributes:** Order Date, Sales, Profit, Category, Sub-category, Region, etc.

## 🔍 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned and prepped:
1. **Removed duplicates** and checked for missing values.
2. **Standardized column names** for consistency.
3. **Converted date formats** to ensure proper analysis.
